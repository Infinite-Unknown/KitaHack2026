Problem Statement
Practical AI Solutions for Real-World Impact Using Google Technology
Background
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight some of the most pressing global challenges, including poverty, quality education, healthcare access, climate change, and sustainable urban development. Despite ongoing efforts, many existing solutions lack scalability, efficiency, and accessibility, making it difficult to create lasting, widespread impact.
Technology has the potential to transform how we tackle these challenges by enhancing efficiency, decision-making, and resource optimization. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a powerful tool, impactful solutions can also be built using other innovative technologies, such as cloud computing, real-time data analytics, IoT, blockchain, and mobile applications.
Challenge
How can we develop innovative, scalable, and sustainable AI-powered solutions that address real-world problems aligned with one or more SDGs using Google's technology stack, moving from theoretical knowledge to deployable applications that create measurable community impact?
Participants are encouraged to experiment with Google's advanced capabilities in ML, language AI, visual computing, and analytics. To combine these with Google's cloud infrastructure to create applications that drive genuine progress toward social and environmental goals.
Key Considerations
Does the solution incorporate AI? If so, how does it enhance efficiency, decision-making, or automation?
How does the solution ensure accessibility, affordability, and scalability, especially in underserved communities?
What role can Google technologies (e.g., Google Cloud, Firebase, Google Maps API, TensorFlow) play in enhancing the solution?
How does the solution align with ethical and sustainable development principles?

Registration to participate in KitaHack 2026 is FOC.
The platform used throughout the event will be discord or bevy platform.
Any kind of tampering with the competition’s registration, flow and/or result in any way will result in the participant/team being disqualified from Kitahack.
Any form of harassment, discrimination, or disruptive behaviour towards other participants, mentors, judges, or organizers will cause immediate disqualification.
Submission Guidelines
The submitted solution must incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technology as a key component and address one or more United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
All work on the project must be completed during the official duration of the hackathon.
The submission and all its components must be the team's original work. While referencing existing solutions is permitted, direct plagiarism of ideas, code, or designs is strictly prohibited.
Participants are not allowed to plagiarize the ideas, work, or submissions of other teams.
All submissions must be made before the specified deadline. Any incomplete, illegible, misdirected, or late submissions will not be considered.
Submissions that contain or promote dangerous, vulgar, offensive, indecent, illegal, racist, plagiarized, cruel, or fraudulent content—or that infringe on the rights or copyright of others—will cause immediate disqualification.
 Submission Criteria
Your final submission must include the implementation of an AI technology (such as Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, Gemini, or other AI solutions) along with the integration of a separate Google technology (Google Technology outside of the incorporated Google AI or any other AI Technology) to enhance functionality.
Your submission MUST contain ALL the components below: o Incorporate AI Technology
Google AI Technology - such as Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, Gemini (Recommended)
Other AI Technology - you will receive only half of the total marks
for AI implementation.
Incorporate Google Technology (Any Google Technology outside Google AI)
Firebase, GCP, Google Maps API, Android Studio, etc.
Preliminary Round Requirements
At a minimum, your submission should be a low-code solution.
A semi-working prototype is strongly encouraged.
No-code submissions will not be accepted.
Final Round Requirements
A working prototype is expected from the participants
The final submission should be an extension and improvement of your preliminary round entry.
AI Usage Requirement
All submissions must incorporate AI and exclusively utilize Google AI technologies only, i.e. Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, Gemini or other Google AI Technologies.
Use of non-Google related AI models for core AI functionalities will result in
significantly reduced scoring.
Technical Stack
Each project must incorporate at least one Google developer technology, such as Google Cloud Platform services, Firebase, Google Maps API, Google Workspace, TensorFlow, or any other Google-related tools or APIs. The chosen technology should be significant and integral to the functionality or innovation of the project.
Incorporating AI (i.e. Gemini) into the solution is mandatory. Projects that effectively integrate AI should enhance functionality, scalability, or impact will be strongly encouraged and valued. AI should be used to meaningfully improve the solution’s effectiveness.
Failure to integrate at least one Google technology may cause disqualification at the discretion of the organizers. Teams are encouraged to highlight how Google technologies enhance their project during their submission.
Awards
All awards and prizes must be shared among all team members as per their mutual agreement.
Prizes are non-transfierable and can only be claimed by the designated winner(s).
The judges' and organizers' decisions regarding the selection of winners are final and binding. No appeals, disputes, or reconsiderations will be entertained.
