Despite ongoing efforts, many existing solutions lack scalability, efficiency, and accessibility, making it difficult to create lasting, widespread impact.Technology has the potential to transform how we tackle these challenges by enhancing efficiency, decision-making, and resource optimization. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a powerful tool, impactful solutions can also be built using other innovative technologies, such as cloud computing, real-time data analytics, IoT, blockchain, and mobile applications.ChallengeHow can we develop innovative, scalable, and sustainable AI-powered solutions that address real-world problems aligned with one or more SDGs using Google's technology stack, moving from theoretical knowledge to deployable applications that create measurable community impact?Participants are encouraged to experiment with Google's advanced capabilities in ML, language AI, visual computing, and analytics. To combine these with Google's cloud infrastructure to create applications that drive genuine progress toward social and environmental goals.Key ConsiderationsDoes the solution incorporate AI? If so, how does it enhance efficiency, decision-making, or automation?How does the solution ensure accessibility, affordability, and scalability, especially in underserved communities?What role can Google technologies (e.g., Google Cloud, Firebase, Google Maps API, TensorFlow) play in enhancing the solution?How does the solution align with ethical and sustainable development principles?Rules & RegulationsEligibilityTeams must have at least one GDGoC Member from a Malaysian chapter : 1.
